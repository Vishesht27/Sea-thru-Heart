## Introduction

Today, cardiovascular disease (CVD) kills the majority of people worldwide. Given the severity of this condition, the analysis and diagnosis of CVD becomes critical. In the presence of subject matter experts (SMEs), this task becomes trivial. On the other hand, a phonocardiogram (PCG) is almost always impossible without the aid of an SME to diagnose cardiovascular disease with the aid of an electrocardiogram (ECG). In both of the above cases, the deep learning method proposed in this paper can serve as a convenient tool to help the field of diagnosis in this regard. Electrocardiographic analysis, PCG is the main basis for exploring the heart health of patients. Various methods have been proposed to analyze these vital signs individually, however, this paper provides a comprehensive and detailed overview of the analysis of the above-mentioned collection of data. Minimizing false negative predictions is necessary for the medical field, otherwise these false predictions pose an immediate threat to patients.
